# if you want to run it then have all the following dependencies installed:

# have node js installed, and then you should be able to run the server from the terminal as **node server.js**

# once you run the server, you have to type **localhost:1234** on any browser, try to open two tabs and open the same link

# also if for some reason , you can't find it running , you can look at the video as to what the results are of running the program

# although i am including node_modules folder which contains all the dependencies, if you find any error such as 'ws' module not found, you can just install it using **npm install ws** and can do the same thing for all the modules that are missing
